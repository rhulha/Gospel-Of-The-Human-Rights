# Gospel of the Human Rights

A creative writing project that transforms the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into parable-style stories, featuring Jeremiah son of Samuel, a wise potter who travels from village to village sharing wisdom and helping those in need.

## Project Overview

This project reimagines each of the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as biblical-style parables. The stories follow Jeremiah, son of Samuel (a potter), as he encounters various situations and people that illustrate the fundamental human rights principles in an accessible, narrative format.

### Key Features

- **30 Parable Stories**: One story for each article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- **Consistent Character**: Jeremiah son of Samuel serves as the wise traveler and protagonist throughout all stories
- **Biblical Style**: Stories are written in a parable format reminiscent of biblical narratives
- **AI-Assisted Generation**: Uses multiple AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) to generate the stories
- **Educational Purpose**: Makes human rights concepts more accessible through storytelling

## Character Background

**Jeremiah son of Samuel** is the central character in all stories:
- **Profession**: Traveling teacher and helper
- **Background**: Son of Samuel, a wise potter
- **Characteristics**: Kind, wise, patient, and insightful
- **Purpose**: Travels from village to village, helping people understand justice, equality, and human dignity through stories and examples
