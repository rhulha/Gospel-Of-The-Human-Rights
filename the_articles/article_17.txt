Chapter 17.

The Right to Own Property.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, arrived in the village of Sychar, a place nestled beside a fertile valley. He set up his potter’s wheel under the shade of a large sycamore tree near the market, and soon a small crowd gathered, drawn by his reputation for wisdom.

Presently, a man named Reuben, his face creased with distress, pushed through the onlookers. "Master Jeremiah," he began, his voice tight, "I am a farmer. My family has tilled a small plot of land by the river for three generations. It is not grand, but it is ours. We have the deed, signed by the elders of old."

Jeremiah nodded, his hands still gently shaping the clay on his wheel. "Speak on, Reuben."

"A wealthy landowner, Josiah, who owns much of the valley, now claims our plot. He says he can make better use of it, that his larger herds need the riverside access. He has offered a pittance, far less than its worth to us, and threatens to have the village council seize it if we do not yield. He says one family's small holding should not stand in the way of progress that benefits many."

Another voice, a woman named Tamar, piped up, "And some of us wished to buy a communal olive press, Master. We pooled our savings, a small group of us, so we could all benefit. But Josiah’s steward told us we could not, that such enterprises must be managed by established landowners like his master, not by a mere association of common folk."

Jeremiah stopped his wheel. He wiped his clay-covered hands on a cloth. "My father Samuel," he said, his voice carrying clearly, "often spoke of the earth and what springs from it. He would say, 'The clay in the riverbed is there for any to gather. But when a potter takes that clay, and with his skill and labor fashions a jar, that jar becomes his. It is the fruit of his effort, a vessel for his livelihood.'"

He looked at Reuben. "Your family's land, tilled and nurtured by their sweat and care, is like that fashioned jar. It is yours, a testament to your heritage and your sustenance. To have it taken arbitrarily, without just cause or fair recompense, is like smashing a potter’s finest work simply because another desires the shelf it sits upon."

Then, turning to Tamar, he continued, "And just as one potter may own his creations, so too may many potters join their skills and resources to build a larger kiln, or to buy clay in greater measure, sharing both the work and the reward. The right to own property, whether alone like Reuben's ancestral land, or in association with others, like your desired communal press, is a foundation of a just community. It allows individuals and groups to build, to prosper, and to secure their future."

He picked up a small, perfectly formed pot he had just finished. "This pot is mine, made by my own hands. I may keep it, sell it, or gift it. Another may covet it, but they cannot simply take it. So too should it be with what you rightfully possess or seek to possess together through honest means."

The villagers murmured their understanding. Josiah, who had been listening from the edge of the crowd, felt a flush of shame. He later approached Reuben, not with threats, but with a respectful offer to purchase a small, unused portion of the land at a fair price, which Reuben, after consideration, accepted for a part he could spare, while retaining the heart of his family's heritage. And the group with Tamar found new courage to pursue their communal olive press, with others now more willing to support their right to do so.

For Jeremiah taught that the right to own what one has earned or inherited, and to be secure in that ownership, was essential for the dignity and stability of all people.
