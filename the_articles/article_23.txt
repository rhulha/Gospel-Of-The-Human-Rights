Chapter 23.

The Unequal Measures.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, arrived at the village of Adar, known for its fine linens woven by skilled hands. Yet, as he walked through the marketplace, he sensed a weariness that clung to the people like the dust of the road. That evening, as he sat by the village well, a group of weavers, men and women, approached him. Their shoulders were slumped, and their eyes held a quiet desperation.

One woman, named Tamar, spoke first. "Jeremiah, son of Samuel, your wisdom is spoken of even in Adar. We are skilled weavers, yet we struggle. Master Elkanah, who owns the looms and buys our linen, sets the terms. We have no choice but to accept the work he offers, for there is little else."

A man named Boaz added, "And the conditions, Jeremiah! The loomshed is dim and airless, and the hours are from before sunrise until after sunset. We are paid barely enough to feed our children, a few copper coins for a bolt of linen that he sells for many silver pieces in the city."

Another woman, Dinah, stepped forward, her voice trembling slightly. "And there is more injustice. I weave linen as fine as any man here, yet Elkanah pays me less, saying a woman's work is worth less. Is my skill not the same? Does my family not hunger the same?"

Jeremiah listened patiently, his gaze kind. When they had finished, he nodded slowly. "My father, Samuel, a potter of no small skill, often spoke of the dignity of honest labour. He would say, 'A potter who starves his apprentice or gives him tools that wound his hands will soon find his workshop empty, or his pots cracked and worthless. But the potter who values the hands that shape the clay, who ensures they are fairly rewarded and work in safety, will see his shelves filled with vessels of beauty and strength, and his reputation shine.'"

He looked at the weavers. "My father also taught that just as clay needs the right measure of water and fire to become strong, so too does a worker need fair conditions and just pay to flourish. He believed that every person has a right to work, and to choose that work freely, not under duress. He said that all who do the same work, with the same skill, deserve the same reward, regardless of who they are. And that the reward for labour should be enough for a person and their family to live with dignity, not in constant fear of hunger."

Jeremiah then gestured to a bundle of reeds nearby. "One reed alone is easily broken," he said, picking one up and snapping it. "But many reeds bound together?" He gathered a handful. "They are strong. You have a right to speak together, to form a council, to voice your needs to Master Elkanah as one, for the protection of your shared interests. For work is not merely toil; it is a path to dignity, and the conditions of that path must be just and favourable for all who walk it."

The weavers looked at each other, a new light dawning in their eyes. They thanked Jeremiah, and as he prepared to leave Adar the next morning, he saw them gathered, speaking with newfound courage, no longer as scattered individuals, but as a community seeking the fairness that was their due.
