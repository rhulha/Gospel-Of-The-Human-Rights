Chapter 5.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, journeyed to the village of Adummim, a place known for its stern magistrate and harsh judgments. As he approached the village square, a low murmur of distress reached his ears. He saw a small crowd gathered, and in their midst, a young man, barely more than a boy, was tied to a post, his back already bearing angry red welts from a whip. An older woman, her face a mask of anguish, rushed towards Jeremiah, recognizing him from tales of his wisdom.

"Jeremiah, son of Samuel!" she cried, clutching his arm. "My nephew, young David. He was caught taking a few figs from the magistrate's orchard, for his little sisters were hungry. Now, the magistrate has ordered him flogged, and then to be left in the stocks under the midday sun without water, as a public shame. Is this… is this right? To inflict such suffering, such humiliation?"

Jeremiah looked at the boy, whose shoulders sagged under the weight of pain and despair. His gaze then met the magistrate’s, who stood by, arms crossed, observing the punishment.

Jeremiah turned to the woman, his voice gentle but firm. "Good woman," he began, "my father, Samuel, the potter, often spoke of the nature of his craft. He would say, 'When I find a flaw in the clay, or when a pot does not take the shape I intend, do I smash it with uncontrolled fury? Do I grind it into dust with contempt? Nay. For even if the vessel is imperfect, the clay itself is still worthy. I might gently reshape it, or if it must be broken, I do so with the intent to reclaim the clay for a new purpose, not to defile it.'"

He paused, letting his words sink in, his eyes sweeping over the quieted crowd and resting again on the magistrate. "My father taught that a human being, made with far greater care than any earthen pot, possesses an inherent dignity. To subject any person to torture, to inflict pain that is cruel and serves only to break their spirit, or to degrade them before their kin and community, is to act as if they are less than human. It is to take a hammer to the finest vessel, not to mend, but to shatter. Such actions do not heal a wrong; they only deepen the wounds in the community and harden the hearts of men."

The magistrate shifted uncomfortably. The woman, tears now of understanding rather than just sorrow, asked, "So, even when someone has erred, their very being should not be violated by the punishment?"

Jeremiah nodded. "Indeed. For no one should be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. To do so is to forget that every soul is precious, and that correction, if needed, should aim to restore, not to destroy the spirit within."

The crowd murmured, and some began to look at the magistrate with questioning eyes. The boy at the post, though still in pain, lifted his head a fraction, a flicker of hope in his eyes at Jeremiah's words.
