Chapter 7.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, his hands still bearing the faint scent of clay and kiln, arrived in the bustling market town of Kiriath-Jearim. A crowd had gathered near the town well, the usual hub of commerce and gossip, but today, the mood was tense. Two men stood before the town elder, a stern-faced man named Micah.

One was a wealthy merchant, Reuben, known for his fine linens and sharp dealings. The other was a poor farmer, Gideon, his clothes patched and his face etched with worry. Reuben was accusing Gideon of damaging a cart laden with valuable dyes, claiming Gideon’s stray ox had caused the mishap.

"He must pay for the full value of the dyes and the repair of my cart!" Reuben declared, his voice booming. "My word is known in this town! His is… well, he is just Gideon."

Gideon wrung his hands. "Elder Micah, my ox was tethered. It could not have reached his cart. But he will not listen. He says because I am poor, my word is worth less than his dust."

Elder Micah seemed swayed by Reuben’s confidence and standing. "Gideon," he said, his brow furrowed, "Reuben is a man of substance. His losses are great. It is likely your carelessness caused this."

Just then, Jeremiah stepped forward, his calm presence drawing eyes. "Elder Micah," he said, his voice gentle but clear, "may an outsider offer a thought?"

Micah, recognizing the wisdom-seeker, nodded. "Speak, Jeremiah son of Samuel."

Jeremiah addressed the crowd, but his gaze included the elder. "My father, Samuel, a man of much thought, often spoke of the scales. He would say, 'When you weigh grain, does the scale tip differently if the grain belongs to a king or a beggar? No. A measure is a measure. So too must be the law.' The sun does not inquire into a man’s wealth before shining upon his field, nor does the rain ask his station before quenching his thirsty crops. Should the law, then, be less impartial than the sun and the rain?"

He turned to Elder Micah. "The law is a shelter, built for all. If it protects one man more than another, or if it allows one to accuse and be believed merely on account of his riches while another is dismissed for his poverty, then the shelter has holes, and justice will be washed away by the first storm of dispute."

He continued, "Indeed, the law must not only be a fair judge but also a strong shield. If one man is discriminated against, if his rights are trampled because of who he is, or if another incites others to treat him unfairly, the law must stand firm to protect him, just as it would protect the most powerful."

A murmur went through the crowd. Elder Micah looked at Reuben, then at Gideon, his expression thoughtful. He had been quick to lean towards the word of the powerful.

"You speak with the clarity of fresh water, Jeremiah," Micah said. "Reuben, Gideon, we shall investigate this matter fully. Both your words will be weighed with the same measure. We will seek witnesses and examine the scene. The law must serve all, equally."

Reuben grumbled but knew he could not argue against such reason, especially with the crowd now nodding in agreement with Jeremiah. Gideon’s face, etched with worry moments before, now held a flicker of hope. He saw that perhaps, under a just law, even a poor farmer could find protection. Jeremiah smiled, knowing that the seed of true justice, once planted, had a chance to grow.
