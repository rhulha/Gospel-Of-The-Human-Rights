Chapter 2.

And it came to pass that Jeremiah, son of Samuel the potter, journeyed to the village of Eshta, nestled by a winding river. As he approached the market square, he saw a commotion near the community well. A woman, her garments dusty from travel and her accent different from the local tongue, was being denied water by a group of village men.

"She is not of Eshta," one man declared loudly. "Her people are from the Sunstone Hills, and their ways are not our ways. Let her find water among her own."

Another added, "Her husband barters in strange goods, and some say their beliefs about the heavens are misguided. Why should she share in what is ours?"

The woman stood silent, her eyes downcast, her empty water skin clutched in her hand.

Jeremiah, seeing her distress, made his way through the crowd. The villagers, recognizing him, made way, and an elder named Caleb addressed him. "Master Jeremiah, you see the contention. This woman is a newcomer, from a territory whose allegiances are different from ours. Is it not right that the privileges of Eshta are for the people of Eshta?"

Jeremiah looked at the woman, then at the villagers. He then stooped and picked up a handful of pebbles from the ground – some smooth and river-worn, some jagged and dark, some pale and chalky.

He held them out in his palm. "Tell me, Caleb," he began, his voice calm yet carrying over the murmurs, "does the sun shine only on the fields of Eshta? Does the rain fall only upon your rooftops, and not upon the Sunstone Hills?"

Caleb frowned. "Of course not, Master. The sun and rain are for all."

"And the air you breathe," Jeremiah continued, "does it distinguish between one who was born in this valley and one who crossed the mountain pass? Does the river, from which this well draws its life, ask the allegiance of the thirsty before offering its refreshment?"

He gestured to the pebbles. "My father, Samuel, was a potter. He would gather clay from many places – some red, some grey, some from our own valley, some brought by traders from afar. He shaped them all upon his wheel. Some became fine cups, others sturdy bowls, yet others simple bricks. Did the fire of his kiln treat one clay differently from another based on its origin or its colour? Nay, it baked each according to its nature, making it useful.

"So too," Jeremiah said, his gaze sweeping across the faces before him, "are the fundamental blessings of life – the right to quench one’s thirst, to speak one’s mind, to live without fear, to be treated with dignity. These are not gifts to be hoarded by one village or one people, withheld from another due to the sound of their voice, the shade of their skin, the manner of their worship, or the land of their birth. The Great Potter who fashioned us all intended for every vessel, no matter its origin or appearance, to be capable of holding the waters of life and respect."

He then gently took the woman's water skin, filled it from the well, and handed it back to her with a kind smile. The men who had blocked her path looked down, a sense of shame dawning on their faces. The elder, Caleb, nodded slowly. "Your words are wise, son of Samuel. The well is for all who thirst."

And from that day, the people of Eshta remembered Jeremiah's lesson: that the essence of being human, and the rights that accompany it, belong to everyone, everywhere, without distinction.
