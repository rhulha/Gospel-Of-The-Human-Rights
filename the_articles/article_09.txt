Chapter 9.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, was passing through the dusty outskirts of a village named Adummim when a woman, her face streaked with tears and dust, ran towards him. "Oh, wise Jeremiah!" she cried, clutching his arm. "My husband, Elkanah, a good carpenter, was seized this very morning! The magistrate’s guards came to our home, bound him, and dragged him to the cells beneath the courthouse. They gave no reason, no charge! He was simply mending a neighbour's plough."

Jeremiah’s gaze softened as he listened. He set down the leather satchel containing his potter's tools. "Tell me, good woman," he said gently, "was there any accusation spoken, any fault laid at his door?"

"None, master! None at all," she sobbed. "He is an honest man. We live in fear now, not knowing why he was taken, or if he will ever be returned to us, or if they will cast him out from our village forever."

Jeremiah nodded slowly, his brow furrowed. He then spoke, his voice clear and steady, reaching the ears of others who had begun to gather. "My father, Samuel, a man of much wisdom, often taught us this: 'Consider the potter and his clay. He does not idly break a vessel he has formed, nor does he cast it into the kiln without purpose. And if a shepherd must separate a sheep from the flock, he does so for a known reason – for shearing, for healing, or if it strays. He does not seize it in anger or caprice, nor lock it away without cause, nor drive it into the wilderness on a whim.'

"So too," Jeremiah continued, his eyes sweeping over the anxious faces, "must it be with men and women. No person should be snatched from their life, their home, their family, like a stone pulled from a wall, weakening the entire structure. To arrest a man without declaring his alleged wrong, to detain him without fair hearing, or to banish him from his community without just cause and lawful judgment, is an offence against dignity and a seed of great bitterness. For a community to thrive in trust, each soul must be secure from such arbitrary shadows."

The people listened, and a murmur of understanding passed through them. The woman, though still sorrowful, found a sliver of clarity in his words, understanding the deep injustice her husband faced.
