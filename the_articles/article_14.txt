Chapter 14.

The Right to Asylum.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, journeyed towards the village of Ramah, known for its sturdy walls and the wisdom of its elders. As he approached, he saw a commotion at the gates. A woman, her clothes torn and face smudged with dust and tears, was pleading with the gatekeepers. Behind her, in the distance, a small group of riders kicked up dust, clearly in pursuit.

"Let me in, I beg you!" she cried. "They seek my life, though I have done no wrong!"

The gatekeepers were hesitant. "Woman, you are a stranger from Gilead. Your troubles are not ours. If we take you in, we may invite the wrath of your pursuers upon Ramah."

Jeremiah stepped forward. "Peace be with you, brothers," he said to the gatekeepers, and then to the woman, "And with you, daughter. Tell us, why do they hunt you?"

The woman, whose name was Tamar, gasped for breath. "I am from Gilead. Our new chieftain, a cruel man named Boaz, demanded that all families give up their eldest sons for his unending wars, or pay a ruinous tax we cannot afford. My husband spoke out in the market square, saying it was unjust. That night, Boaz's men came. They dragged my husband away, and I fear he is dead. They said I was next, for 'harbouring a rebellious spirit.' I fled with only the clothes on my back."

One of the village elders, who had come to the gate, spoke. "Jeremiah, son of Samuel, your wisdom is known. This woman claims persecution. But what if she is a common criminal, fleeing justice from her own land? Should Ramah become a haven for such?"

Jeremiah looked at Tamar's terrified eyes, then at the distant, approaching riders. He addressed the elder and the assembled villagers:

"My father, Samuel, a man of great understanding, once told me a story. A small bird, buffeted by a terrible storm, sought refuge in the eaves of a granary. The granary owner at first thought to shoo it away, fearing it might soil his grain. But then he saw the hawk circling above, waiting for the small bird to be driven out. He understood then that the bird sought not to steal, but to live.

This woman, Tamar," Jeremiah continued, his voice resonating with compassion, "does she appear as one who has robbed or murdered? Her crime, she says, was that her husband spoke against injustice, and she shared his spirit. She flees not the hand of fair justice, but the shadow of tyranny.

Indeed, every soul has the right to flee the crushing fist of persecution and seek safety in another land. If a person is pursued for genuine crimes – for theft, for violence, for acts that tear at the fabric of peace and common decency – then the land they flee to has no obligation to shield them from just consequences. But when one is hunted for their beliefs, for speaking truth to power, or simply for being in the path of a cruel master, then to offer sanctuary is a sacred duty. It is to affirm that life and liberty are precious, and that the hunted deserve a place to breathe free from fear."

He turned to the gatekeepers. "Look at her. She seeks not to cause harm, but to escape it. To offer her refuge is to uphold the dignity of life itself."

The elder nodded slowly, his gaze softening as he looked at Tamar. "The son of Samuel speaks with the heart of his father. Open the gates. Let her find shelter within Ramah."

The gates creaked open, and Tamar stumbled gratefully inside, collapsing in exhaustion just as the pursuing riders reached the outer perimeter, only to be met by the stern faces of Ramah's guards and the closed gates. They shouted threats, but seeing the resolve of Ramah, eventually turned and rode away in frustration.

And so, the people of Ramah learned from Jeremiah that day about the sacred right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution, a beacon of hope for those fleeing injustice, as long as their own hands were clean of true wrongdoing.
