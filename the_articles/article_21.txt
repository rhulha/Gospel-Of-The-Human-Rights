Chapter 21.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, arrived in the village of Kedar as the sun dipped low, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple. He set up his potter's wheel near the well, the customary gathering place. Soon, a small crowd assembled, drawn by the novelty of a visitor and the rhythmic whir of his wheel.

A man named Elkanah, known for his thoughtful nature but hesitant demeanor, stepped forward. "Master Jeremiah," he began, his voice barely above a whisper, "we are troubled. Our village is governed by a council of elders, chosen long ago. They are good men, but they are old, and their ways are fixed. Many younger folk, and even some not so young, feel our concerns are not heard. Decisions are made about the market, the watch, even the distribution of water, without our input. Some among us have skills and ideas that could benefit Kedar, but there seems no path for us to serve, for the council chooses its own successors from among their kin."

Another villager, a woman named Miriam, added, "Indeed! My son is quick with numbers and fair-minded, perfect for overseeing the market dues, yet only the nephew of Elder Simeon is ever considered for such tasks. It feels as if the village belongs to a few, not to all."

Jeremiah listened patiently, his hands never ceasing their work, coaxing a vessel from the yielding clay. When they had finished, he looked up, his eyes kind.

"My father, Samuel," he said, his voice carrying clearly in the evening air, "often spoke of the well from which a village draws its life. He would ask, 'If only one family is allowed to draw water, or if the path to the well is open only to a chosen few, will the village thrive? Or will some go thirsty, and others grow resentful?'"

He paused, letting the image settle. "He told me of a time when his own village faced a similar crossroads. The elders were wise, but they had grown distant from the daily lives of the people. One day, a proposal was made to build a new granary. The elders decided on a plan and a location. But when the young farmers, who knew the land best, heard of it, they saw flaws. The chosen site was prone to damp, and the design was too small for the expected harvest."

"At first," Jeremiah continued, "the elders dismissed their concerns. But my father, then a younger man, spoke up. He said, 'Honoured Elders, the strength of this village is not in the wisdom of a few alone, but in the combined wisdom of all. The hands that till the soil know its secrets. The voices that speak from experience should be heard. Let us all have a say in matters that affect us all. Let those who wish to serve, and are able, be given the chance, not by favour, but by the trust of the community.'"

"The elders, after much deliberation, agreed to listen. They held a village assembly. The farmers shared their knowledge, the builders their expertise. A new plan was drawn, a better site chosen. And when it came time to choose overseers for the project, they were selected not for their family ties, but for their proven skill and the people's confidence in them. The granary they built stood strong for many generations, a testament to what happens when everyone has a voice and a chance to contribute."

Jeremiah looked at Elkanah and Miriam. "A village, like a body, needs all its parts to function well. The head cannot say to the hands, 'I have no need of you.' The authority of those who lead should be a reflection of the will of all the people, like a clear pool reflecting the sky. And the opportunity to serve, to contribute one's talents to the common good, should be open to all, like the path to the village well, accessible to every soul who thirsts for the betterment of their community."

The villagers of Kedar pondered his words. The rhythmic sound of the potter's wheel filled the silence, a gentle reminder of creation and shaping. A murmur of understanding and new resolve passed through the crowd as they considered how their own village well might be made accessible to all.
