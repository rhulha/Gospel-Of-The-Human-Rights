Chapter 6.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, his hands still bearing the faint scent of clay from his morning's work, journeyed to the village of Adummim, a place known for its bustling marketplace but also for its somewhat insular ways. As he set up his small mat near the well, a woman approached him, her face etched with distress.

"Master Jeremiah," she began, her voice trembling, "I am Elara, a widow from the hill country. My husband, before he passed, made an agreement with a merchant here in Adummim for a shipment of wool. The wool was delivered, but the merchant now refuses payment, and worse, when I sought the counsel of the village elders, they dismissed me. 'You are not of Adummim,' they said. 'Your agreements hold no standing here. We do not recognize your claims.'"

Jeremiah listened, his gaze steady. He then picked up a simple, unadorned clay cup he had made, one that had traveled with him through many villages.

"Elara," he said gently, "behold this cup. In my village of Ramah, it is a cup, fit to hold water. When I carried it to Bethel, did it cease to be a cup? And now, here in Adummim, does it suddenly lose its nature, its ability to be recognized for what it is â€“ a vessel?"

Elara shook her head. "No, Master. It is still a cup."

"Indeed," Jeremiah affirmed. "Its essence, its 'cup-ness,' travels with it. So it is with a person. Are you not Elara, a woman, a human being, whether you stand in the hills or in this marketplace? Does crossing a village boundary strip you of your personhood, your inherent being, in the eyes of justice?"

He turned to the small crowd that had gathered. "My father, Samuel, a man of much wisdom, often taught that the law, to be true, must first see the person. It cannot declare someone invisible or without voice simply because their home is elsewhere, or their accent unfamiliar. To be a person is to have a presence that the law must acknowledge, a voice it must be willing to hear, no matter where that person stands."

He looked back at Elara. "Go again to the elders, Elara. Tell them that Jeremiah, son of Samuel, reminds them that even a stranger is a person before the law, everywhere. Her existence, her ability to make a claim, is a right. Whether her claim has merit is for them to judge, but her right to be heard as a person is not for them to deny."

The people murmured, and some of the elders who had overheard shifted uncomfortably. Elara, a little more courage in her eyes, nodded and went to seek justice once more, armed with the simple truth that her humanity was not bound by geography.
