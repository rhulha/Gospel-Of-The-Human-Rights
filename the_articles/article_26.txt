Chapter 26.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, arrived in the village of Kedar, nestled in a valley where the children played with sticks and stones, their laughter echoing, yet their eyes holding an unsparked curiosity. He set up his potter’s wheel under the shade of a broad sycamore tree, and soon, a small crowd gathered, drawn by his quiet presence.

An elder of the village, a woman named Deborah, her face etched with the wisdom of many seasons, approached him. "Jeremiah," she began, her voice troubled, "we see our children grow, strong in limb, but their minds are like untilled fields. Some say learning is only for the sons of merchants or the scribes in the city. Others believe only boys need bother with letters, while girls should learn only household tasks. We are poor, and teachers are few. What is the path for our young ones?"

Jeremiah took a lump of raw, unformed clay from his bag. He placed it on his wheel but did not yet spin it. "Behold this clay," he said, his voice gentle but clear. "As it is, it holds potential, but it serves little purpose. It cannot hold water, nor can it grace a table. It is simply earth."

He then dipped his hands in water and began to work the clay, his wheel turning steadily. "My father, Samuel, a man of much thought, often said, 'Every child is a seed. Some seeds grow into mighty cedars, others into fragrant herbs, yet others into fruitful vines. But every seed must first be given good soil, water, and sunlight to sprout and reveal its true nature.' So too, every child, boy or girl, rich or poor, must be given the basic nourishment for their minds. To learn to read the signs, to understand numbers, to hear the stories of their people and of others – this is like giving a seed its first taste of sun and rain. It should be as freely given as the air we breathe, and it is the duty of the community to ensure this ground is fertile for all."

A young man, a carpenter named Ethan, spoke up. "But what of learning beyond these basics, Jeremiah? What of the skills for a trade, or the deeper understanding of the world?"

Jeremiah smiled, shaping a simple cup on his wheel. "Once the seed has sprouted and the sapling is strong," he replied, "then indeed, let those whose minds show a particular thirst, or whose hands display a special aptitude, be guided to deeper wells of knowledge. Technical skills, the wisdom of the ancients, the arts that gladden the heart – these should be open to all who show the merit and the desire to learn. For education is not merely to fill the head with facts, as one fills a pot with grain. It is to shape the spirit, to awaken understanding, to teach respect for all lives and all ways. It is to help each person grow into the fullness of who they were created to be, fostering friendship and peace among all peoples."

Deborah then asked, "And who, then, should guide the first steps of this learning, if the community provides the means?"

Jeremiah nodded, lifting the newly formed cup from the wheel. "Parents," he said, "have the first and most cherished right to choose the paths of learning for their children, to nurture their unique spirits and guide them towards the light of knowledge that best suits their blossoming. For in the light of knowledge, the human spirit finds its truest expression, and communities find their strongest foundations."

The people of Kedar looked at their children, then at the simple cup in Jeremiah's hand, and they understood. To leave a mind untaught was to leave clay unshaped, a field fallow, a precious potential unrealized. They resolved that day to find a way, together, to bring the light of learning to every child in their village.
