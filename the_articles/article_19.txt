Chapter 19.

The Sealed Jars and the Open Spring.

Jeremiah, son of Samuel, journeyed to the village of Azmur, nestled in a valley that, while fertile, seemed strangely muted. The people spoke in hushed tones, and their eyes often darted about as if expecting rebuke. As he set up his potter’s wheel in the small square, a few curious villagers gathered, but none spoke freely.

Finally, a young man named Thaddeus, a scribe’s apprentice, approached him, looking over his shoulder. "Master Jeremiah," he whispered, "we are a people of sealed lips and covered ears."

"Sealed lips? Covered ears?" Jeremiah asked gently, shaping a piece of clay. "Tell me more, son."

"Our Elder, a man named Malachi, believes that new ideas and words from outside bring only trouble," Thaddeus explained. "He says, 'The old ways are the only ways. What is known is safe; what is unknown is a threat.' So, if a traveler brings news from another town, Malachi declares it rumour-mongering. If one of us has a new thought about how to improve our looms or our crop rotation, he calls it foolish fancy and bids us be silent. We cannot even easily obtain scrolls from other regions, for he deems them corrupting."

Another woman, Miriam, a weaver, chimed in, her voice low. "My cousin in the next valley sent word of a new dye she discovered, a vibrant blue from a mountain flower. I wished to learn of it, perhaps even travel to see it, but Malachi forbade any discussion, saying our traditional brown and ochre dyes are sufficient. We live as if Azmur is the only place in the world."

Jeremiah nodded slowly, his hands still working the clay. He then took a finished, fired jar, one with a tightly sealed lid. "Behold this jar," he said to the gathering crowd. "It is strong and well-made. But being sealed, can it receive fresh water? Can it offer refreshment to the thirsty? It holds only what was put into it at the beginning, and that may grow stale."

He then pointed towards the village spring, from which a clear stream trickled. "But look at the spring. It receives water from hidden sources deep within the earth, and perhaps from rains that have travelled from distant seas. It gives freely to all who come, and its waters are ever fresh, ever moving. It shares its bounty, and in turn, it is constantly replenished."

Jeremiah looked at Thaddeus and Miriam. "Your minds and your village are like this. If you seal yourselves off, if you fear to hold an opinion that is new, or to hear a voice from beyond your own borders, you become like the sealed jar. Your thoughts may grow stale, your progress may halt."

"My father, Samuel," Jeremiah continued, "used to say, 'A single thought, kept locked in one mind, is like a seed kept in a dark box; it cannot sprout. But a thought shared, discussed, even debated, is like a seed planted in fertile ground, watered by many rains. It may grow into a mighty tree, offering shade and fruit to all.' He also taught that truth is often found not in one voice, but in the chorus of many – some singing familiar tunes, others bringing new melodies. How can you know the worth of an idea, whether from within your village or from afar, if it is never spoken, never heard, never considered?"

He gestured to the open air around them. "The air carries sounds from all directions. The wind brings seeds from distant fields. So too should ideas and information flow. To hold an opinion in your heart, to seek knowledge from near and far, to receive it openly, and to share what you have learned or what you believe – this is not a threat, but the very lifeblood of a thriving community. It is the right of every soul to think, to speak, and to listen, so that all may grow in wisdom and understanding."

The people of Azmur looked at each other, a new light in their eyes. Thaddeus, the scribe’s apprentice, stood a little taller. Perhaps, he thought, it was time for the waters of knowledge to flow more freely in Azmur.
